This repository contains 2 tasks for Webots  

## Stacking Task
![Stacking Cube task](https://github.com/09ubberboy90/simple_webot_ros2/blob/bbe24b34e19a651f0feb8c4047790903ab244baa/imgs/Webots_place.png "Stacking Cube task")
This task involves one Franka Panda robotic arm randomly taking 5cm cubes from a table with 21 cubes arranged in a 7 * 3 grid and stacking them. It will stack them into 3 stacks of 5 cubes. The number of columns and the the heigt can be configured in [moveit_controller.launch.py](https://github.com/09ubberboy90/simple_pybullet_ros2/blob/a3e75c9919a51bfc330262185354c40cc120376c/pybullet_panda/launch/moveit_controller.launch.py#L58)

## Throw Task
![Throw Task](https://github.com/09ubberboy90/simple_webot_ros2/blob/bbe24b34e19a651f0feb8c4047790903ab244baa/imgs/Webots_throw.png "Throw Task ")

For this, a Franka Panda arm will pick up a cube and throw it toward a pyramid made of 6 cubes. The arm will go as far back as it can and perform a throwing motion toward the ground in front of it. The ball will be released at 50% of the trajectory as it is the moment with the most amount of forces. The pyramid is placed such that a successful throw at full power will collapse it. 

## Instructions

### Requirements

- **OS:** Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal)
  - Other distributions might work (not tested).

### Dependencies

These are the primary dependencies required to use this project.

- ROS 2 [Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/Installation.html)
- [PyBullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/)
- [MoveIt 2](https://moveit.ros.org/install-moveit2/binary)
  - Install/build a version based on the selected ROS 2 release

### Building

Clone this repository and import submodules. Then install dependencies and build with [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io).

```bash
# Install pyquaternion
pip install pyquaternion
# Clone this repository and the submodules into your favourite ROS 2 workspace
git clone https://github.com/09ubberboy90/simple_pybullet_ros2.git
# Install external dependencies via rosdep
rosdep install -r --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}
# Build with colcon
colcon build --merge-install --symlink-install --cmake-args "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release"
```

### Sourcing

Before utilising this package, remember to source the ROS 2 workspace overlay.

```bash
source ${ROS2_WS}/install/local_setup.bash
```

## Running
The following tasks can be either run as an independant launch or can be recorded

### Stacking cube

```
ros2 launch pybullet_panda stack_cubes.launch.py
```
### Throwing cube

```
ros2 launch pybullet_panda throw_cubes.launch.py
```
## Recorder
The recorder can be launched with. 
```
ros2 run sim_recorder run_recording 
```
It has some argument option to configure what the task will be
```
--help: Gives a list of arguments
-t, --throw: Start the Throwing Task
-i, --iteration: Number of run that should be performed
-s, --start: Start index in case some run need to be rerun after an interuption
--headless: runs without a GUI
```

The recorder will save the CPU and RAM usage in `sim_recoder/data/{sim_name}`.
`sim_name` is created automatically based ont the simulation name `ignition` and on the arguments:
- `_gui` is added if `--headless` is not passed
- `_throw` is added if `--throw` is passed

An analysis of the run can be performed by running from the source of the repo
```
python ./sim_recorder/sim_recoder/grapher.py {name_of_folder}
```
With name of folder being the name of the folder you want to analyse
